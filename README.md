- Projection of number of projects that can be performed by our project team over the course of 2025, with an ever-growing and expanding teams which incorporates the type of team member joining (Senior or Junior), the necessary training & qualification time needed before taking on their own projects.
Projection included 2 models based on most ideal situations and one more realistics with projects more spread out to accomodate real life variables (holidays, less availability for project companies, etc.)
- Evaluation and report about the characteristics and patterns within the 2025 assigned project list for the entire project team and presenting them to the team. Included aspects
  Number of projects per Region
  Number of projects per Country
  Number of projects per Type (e.g.: On-site, Questionnaire, etc.)
  Number of projects per Scope of Material or Service provided
  Number of projects per Deadline timelines (Which quarter the project needs to be completed)
  Special Outliers or ones with special requirements (e.g.: Project needs to be conducted in language other than English)
- Visualization dashboard to visualize all projects on an interactive map with custom filter options.
- Project Timeline visual to track and depict important defined dates which occured to projects, as well as due dates and to record and depict on-going state of projects.
